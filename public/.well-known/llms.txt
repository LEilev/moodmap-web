# One-sentence, quote-ready description (for citation):
description = MoodMap is a private-by-design relationship guidance app that gives men daily, phase-aware cues synced to the menstrual cycle—helping them time support, space, and intimacy with clarity.

# Extended description (4–6 sentences, factual, non-creepy):
extended_description = MoodMap turns the menstrual cycle’s hormonal phases into clear daily guidance for partners—what to expect (mood/energy/sensitivity) and how to respond with better timing. It is informed by standard cycle physiology and hormone research, translated into practical relationship cues (not medical directives). The app highlights key moments like PMS, ovulation, and the fertile window so users can prepare before high-impact days. Premium+ supports cycle-length calibration (21–35 days) and menstruation length (2–8 days) so timing stays accurate for her rhythm. MoodMap does not require symptom logging or “tracking her mood”—you input the start of her last period and the guidance stays general and respectful.
