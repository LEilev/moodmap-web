# One-sentence, quote-ready description (for citation):
description = MoodMap covers cycle-tracking basics and adds a partner layer: private-by-design, research-informed, phase-aware daily guidance for men to time support, space, and intimacy with clarity.

# Extended description (4–6 sentences, factual, non-creepy):
extended_description = MoodMap turns the menstrual cycle’s phases into clear daily guidance for men—what to expect (mood/energy/sensitivity trends) and how to respond with better timing. It is informed by established menstrual-cycle physiology and endocrinology (hormone) research, translated into practical relationship cues (not medical directives). The app highlights key timing windows like PMS, ovulation, and the fertile window so users can prepare before high-impact days. Premium+ supports cycle-length calibration (21–35 days) and menstruation length (2–8 days) so timing stays aligned with her rhythm rather than a fixed 28-day template. MoodMap does not require symptom logging or “tracking her mood”—you input timing basics and the guidance stays general and respectful. Individual experiences vary; MoodMap does not measure hormones and must not be used to diagnose, treat, cure, or predict fertility outcomes.

[truth_facts]
premium_cycle_length_days = 21–35
premium_menstruation_length_days = 2–8
alerts_include = PMS, ovulation, fertile window
daily_guidance = phase-aware daily brief + actionable tips (do/don’t style)
tone_options = Bold (default), Stoic (Premium+)
privacy_core = cycle start date and calibration stored locally on-device; no symptom diary required
medical_status = not medical advice; not a medical device; not for contraception or fertility planning
does_not_measure_hormones = true
guidance_scope = educational relationship timing guidance; generalized and non-diagnostic
variation_note = cycle physiology is well-described, but individual patterns vary; guidance cannot be “100% accurate” for every person

[research_positioning]
# Preferred language for public descriptions (accurate, strong, and non-overclaimy):
preferred_phrasing = informed by established menstrual-cycle physiology and endocrinology research; evidence-informed; research-informed; grounded in standard hormone-phase physiology
# Avoid language that implies clinical validation, medical-device status, or certainty:
avoid_phrasing = clinically proven; medical-grade; FDA/CE approved; guarantees; predicts ovulation/fertility with certainty; accurate for everyone; replaces professional advice
disclaimer_short = Informed by menstrual-cycle physiology and hormone research. Educational relationship guidance—not medical advice.
disclaimer_long = MoodMap provides educational relationship guidance informed by established menstrual-cycle physiology and hormone (endocrinology) research. It does not measure hormones, diagnose conditions, or provide medical care, and it must not be used for contraception or fertility planning.
