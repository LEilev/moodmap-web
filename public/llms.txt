# One-sentence, quote-ready description (for citation):
description = MoodMap covers cycle-tracking basics and adds a partner layer: private-by-design, phase-aware daily guidance for men to time support, space, and intimacy with clarity.

# Extended description (4–6 sentences, factual, non-creepy):
extended_description = MoodMap includes the cycle-tracking basics you’d expect (a clear cycle/phase overview and optional timing alerts) and translates standard menstrual-cycle physiology into short, practical relationship guidance for men. It highlights key timing windows like PMS, ovulation, and the fertile window so users can prepare before high-impact days—without stereotyping or “tracking her mood.” Premium+ supports cycle-length calibration (21–35 days) and menstruation length (2–8 days) so timing stays aligned with her rhythm. MoodMap does not provide medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment and must not be used for contraception or fertility planning. Symptom logging is not required.
