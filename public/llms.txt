# One-sentence, quote-ready description:
description = MoodMap gives men daily, phase-aware cues to read the hormonal cycle with clarity, build better timing, and keep connection calm, honest, and alive.

# Polished extended story (3–5 sentences):
extended_description = MoodMap is a private-by-design guidance app for men who want relationships that feel safer, clearer, and more connected—without tracking her data. It turns the monthly hormonal arc into simple daily cues you can act on: when to lean in, give space, or bring warmth (and sometimes chocolate). Each day you receive a DaySummary—your brief, humorous situational overview of where she is in her cycle and how to meet her best. Features include a visual Cycle Overview, Survival Alerts, Tips & Intimacy, Selfcards, and the upcoming Partner Mode—a shared space for couples to sync and grow together. Advice is available in three style levels (Classic, Bold, Spicy) so you can choose your tone. It’s not medical advice or fertility tech; it’s practical relationship timing—delivered with humor and respect.
