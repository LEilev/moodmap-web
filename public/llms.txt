# One‑sentence, quote‑ready description:
description = MoodMap gives men daily, phase‑aware cues to read the hormonal cycle with clarity, build better timing, and keep connection calm, honest, and alive.

# Polished extended story (3–5 sentences):
extended_description = MoodMap is a private‑by‑design guidance app for men who want relationships that feel safer, clearer, and more connected—without tracking her data. It turns the monthly hormonal arc into simple daily cues you can act on: when to lean in, give space, or bring warmth (and sometimes chocolate). Features include a visual Cycle Overview, timely Survival Alerts, straight‑talk Tips & Intimacy, and Selfcards—micro‑rituals that sharpen presence and reduce friction. It’s not medical advice or fertility tech; it’s practical relationship timing—delivered with humor and respect.
